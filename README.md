# col-advent-of-code
Challenges hosted on the Cave Of Linguists Discord server from 01/12/2020 to 25/12/2020. Aimed at beginner/intermediate programmers.


I have no affiliation with the offical advent of code, hosted over at https://adventofcode.com


## Hosting this yourself

This was hosted on a website, through Github Pages.

To host this yourself, **Be sure to replace the submission links for every challenge!** I've updated them in `index.md` and `template.md`, but the other challenges link to an old Google Forms page that is not in use anymore.
