# Challenge 20: Magic Hunting

You are a person obsessed with Santa, specifically his magic. You want to study Santa's magic, so you create special devices that can detect it. You know Santa uses his magic to transport gifts down narrow chimneys, so you tally the coordinates of all the houses with good kids and narrow chimneys. Sadly, you don't have enough Santa Magic Detectorsâ„¢ to monitor each house, so you think of a solution: You'll put each device in the exact centre of each cluster of houses.


## Task
You will be given two arrays X and Y, which contain the X and Y coordinates of the houses respectively. You need to output the coordinate of the exact centre of all those houses.

## Example
```yaml
X: [1, 4, -2]
Y: [0, 2, 4]
Output: (1, 2)

X: [4, 2, 9, 4]
Y: [-3, 4, 10, 1]
Output: (4.75, 3)
```
