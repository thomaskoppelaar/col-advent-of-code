# Challenge 13: Sorting

After packing the presents in those boxes yesterday, Santa put on each box the name of the city that that box is going to, along with the weight of the box. He then asked you to sort them, but he didn't specify whether you should sort them alphabetically or according to the weight. You'll do both.

## Task

You are given two arrays N and W. N has the names of the cities and W has the weights of the boxes in the same order. You need to sort the two arrays twice, once in ascending alphabetical order and the other in ascending weight. (When you sort one array, the other will follow it; as we want to preserve the fact that the nth element of each array corresponds to the nth box)

## Example

```yaml
N: ["Amsterdam", "Chicago", "Berlin"]
W: [20, 30, 10]
Output:
Alphabetical: ["Amsterdam", "Berlin", "Chicago"], [20, 10, 30]
Weight: [10, 20, 30], ["Berlin", "Amsterdam", "Chicago"]
```
Note: You can display the output in any way you see fit, I just want to see stuff sorted.
