# Challenge 11: Ornament generation

You're asked to automagically generate an ASCII christmas tree, given some specific input.

The parameters that you will be given are: 

- `N`: The height of the tree (in lines).
- `S`: A boolean stating whether or not the tree has a star on top.
- `B`: A float stating the chance of a christmas ball to appear in the tree (per spot in the tree).


An example tree with height 6, a star, and a 0% chance of a ball appearing would look something like this:

```
    +
   ^^^
  ^^^^^
 ^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^
    |

```

The same tree, but with a 25% chance of a ball appearing might look something like this:

```
    +
   ^^o
  o^^^^
 ^^^o^^^
^^o^^^^o^
    |

```

Note:
- A `^` is being used to indicate a "regular" tree spot.
- A `+` is being used to indicate a star.
- A `o` is being used to indicate a christmas ball.
- A `|` is being used to indicate the tree trunk.


## Requirements

- The tree top should always be of width 1 (i.e a top that looks like this: `+^` is not possible).
- The tree trunk is always 1 line high.
- **No two christmas balls can be next to each other** (For simplicity's sake they can be on top of one another).


> Author's note: If you feel like the addition of the christmas balls is a bit too much, then I'll accept your submission if it does not use this parameter.
