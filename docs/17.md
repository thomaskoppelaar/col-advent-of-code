# Challenge 17: Odd Tactics

Santa had a little too much to drink last night, and he came up with a terrible idea: Using aerial combat tactics to deliver presents to households. He asks you to calculate the amount of presents that will land on a home given the location of the sleigh and the distances at which presents are thrown.

## Task

Design a function that takes in the following input:

- `S` : the starting location of the house.
- `T` : the ending location of the house.
- `O` : the location of Santa's sleigh.
- `P` : a list of integers containing the distances at which santa throws the presents.

you should return the amount of presents that land on the house.
All locations are listed as integers: You only have to worry about 1 dimension.

## Example
```py
S = 10
T = 20
O = 15
P = [0, 1, 2]
#the presents land on 15, 16, and 17
return: 3

S = 10
T = 20
O = 30
P = [0, 1, 2]
#the presents land on 30, 31, and 32
return: 0

S = 0
T = 5
O = 6
P = [-1, 3, -2]
# the presents land on 5, 9, and 4
return: 2

```
