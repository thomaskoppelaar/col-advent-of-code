# Challenge 9: Candy Cane Madness

You're in charge of Santa's candy cane factory. Your job is to figure out which candy canes are ready for delivery, and which ones are faulty and can be reused.

You have decided that the tallest candy canes are the ones that can be shipped, and that any candy cane below that height can be reused.


## Requirements

Your task is to create a function that takes the following input:

- `N`, the amount of candy canes
- `C`, A list of heights of all the different candy canes.

You need to return the following two integers in a list:

- The number of candy canes that are the tallest,
- The amount of candy cane material that can be reused.

The amount of material that can be reused is calculated by summing up their heights.

## Example


```py
N = 4
C = [3, 2, 1, 3]
return: [2, 3]

N = 3
C = [1, 2, 5]
return: [1,3]

N = 7
C = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 7]
return: [2,15]

```
