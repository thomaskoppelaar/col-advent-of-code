# Challenge 18: A Hidden message

Santa has received an encoded message from an anonymous sender. You're not sure how to interpret the message, but you know that it must be incredibly important. Since it is quite a long message, you decide to automate the process.


## Task

You will be given an input string `S`, which represents the encoded message.
Your return will be the decoded message.

Your task is to figure out how to decode the message, and create a decoder function.
Note: the only letters used in the message are capital.

## Example
```py
S = "PUEVFGZNF"
return: "CHRISTMAS"

S = "UBYVQNL"
return: "HOLIDAY"
```
