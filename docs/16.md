# Challenge 16: Order mania

Remember the christmas shop from day one? They're back, and they've contacted you for a new job: Checking to see if they have all of the supplies in stock to take on all of the incoming orders.


## Task

Your task is to create a function that takes two arguments:

- `S`: A string of uppercase characters representing all items that are in stock.
- `I`: A list of strings containing all incoming orders: Each order consisting of a string of characters.

You need to return a boolean (true/false) stating whether or not there are enough supplies in stock to take on every order.

## Example

```py
S = "BBMBCMBCMCBTT"
I = ["BM", "T"]
return: True


S = "BB"
I = ["B", "BB"]
return: False

S = "BMCBMCBMBMCMB"
I = ["BBBMMC", "T"]
return: False

S = "BBBMMMCCCTTT"
I = ["BMCT", "BMCT", "BMCT"]
return: True
```
