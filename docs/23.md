# Challenge 23: Secret communication

The secret codes are back, and this time you want to communicate back with the sender. So you'll make a decoder and an encoder. 

## Task

The messages are encoded as follows: the letters "a" -> "i" are represented by the numbers "1" -> "9", while letters "j" to "z" are represented by the numbers "10#" to "26#", and a space is just a space. You'll have to make two functions to be able to encode and decode this code.

## Example

```yaml
Input: "santa"
Output: "19#114#20#1"

Input: "815#12#94125#"
Output: "holiday"

Input: "merry christmas"
Output: "13#518#18#25# 3818#919#20#13#119#"
```
