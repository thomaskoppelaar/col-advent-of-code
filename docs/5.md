# Challenge 5: Speed is key

Santa is getting old. It seems that he forgot how fast his reindeer are supposed to go. He asks you to recalculate how fast he needs to be going in order to get to all the houses. He adds that he must be as slow as he can so that he doesn't tire his reindeer.

## Task

You are given 4 inputs:

- `H` - The total number of homes Santa needs to visit
- `G` - The time it takes to deliver a house's gifts (in seconds)
- `D` - The total distance between all cities (in kilometres)
- `T` - The total time that Santa has (in minutes)

You need to calculate in km/h the minimum speed Santa needs to be travelling in order to deliver all the gifts in the time required; going faster than necessary strains the reindeer.

## Example

```yaml
H: 5
G: 3
D: 2
T: 4

Return: 32

H: 24
G: 30
D: 10
T: 60

Return: 12.5
```

Notes:

If you're rounding the result then round up, as to not go too slow and use up more time than given.
We're assuming that inside a city when Santa is delivering gifts he's taking no time to travel between houses, magic.
