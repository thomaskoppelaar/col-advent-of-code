# Challenge 10: Precise time

When Santa's computer broke like a few challenges ago he lost a program that calculated the amount of time needed for his elves to finish wrapping all the gifts. Santa wants you to make a new program, but this time instead of outputting an amount of time he really wants it to output the time at which the elves will be done wrapping (Santa hates mental arithmetic).

## Task

You are given the following variables:

- `G` - The number of gifts
- `E` - The number of elves
- `T` - The time it takes for one elf to wrap one present (in minutes).
- `S` - The starting time

The S variable is a number which equals the number of hours after 00:00 Monday, so S=1 means the start time is 01:00 and S=2.5 is 02:30 etc etc

The output will be the time and day at which thr elves will be done, rounded down to the nearest minute. If the end time is later than 23:59 Sunday then you can have a special message like "get more elves mate" or something lol

## Example

```yaml
G: 10
E: 1
T: 60
S: 0
Return: 10:00 Monday

G: 100
E: 5
T: 60
S: 30
Return: 02:00 Wednesday

G: 1000
E: 1
T: 60
S: 0
Return: That's not enough elves
```
