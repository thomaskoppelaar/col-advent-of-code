# Challenge 3: A lot at stake

Santa's computer broke and he lost a lot of important data, among which is the number of children in each house he's visiting. You, being the IT elf, tried to recover the data but couldn't. While surfing online, you find 2 arrays with population statistics. Those will be enough to save the day. Make a program that calculates the amount of gifts that Santa needs to bring.

## Task

You are given 2 arrays, the first contains the number of houses in each city/country (up for interpretation) that Santa is visiting, the second contains the average number of children in each house of each city/country respectively. You need to calculate the total number of gifts.

## Example

```yaml
Homes: [1,2]
Density: [1, 3]

Return: 7

Homes: [5, 4, 8]
Density: [2, 1.5, 2.5]

Return: 36
```
