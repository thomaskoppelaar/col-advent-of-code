# Challenge 12: Packing

The elves are now packing the presents. All the presents are cubes of the same size, but the boxes in which they'll pack those cubes are cuboids. Santa needs to know how many presents can fit into each box.

## Task

You are given the following variables:

- `V` - The volume of each present
- `L` - The length of the box
- `W` - The width of the box
- `H` - The height of the box

You need to output the number of presents that can fit into each box. Keep in mind that the presents are rigid, so they don't have to completely fill the box.

## Example

```yaml
V: 27
L: 3
W: 3
H: 3
Return: 1

V: 8
L: 4
W: 4
H: 5
Return: 8

V: 10
L: 1
W: 100
H: 100
Return: 0
```
