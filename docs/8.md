# Challenge 8: Staircase

> Author's note: I spent a lot of time bugfixing an assignment for uni last night so the creative neurons haven't woken up yet.

You are tasked with writing a program that prints out stairs. The base and height of each staircase must always be equal.
Take this example staircase of size 4 going left:

```
   #
  ##
 ###
####
```
Note that it is exactly 4 lines long, and that the staircase is left-aligned.

## Requirements

Design a function that takes in a single input `N`, and prints a left-aligned staircase of that size.

## Example
Note: any space is denoted by an asterisk (*), to clarify the output.
```
N: 1
return:
---
#
---

N: 2
return:
---
*#
##
---

N: 4
return:
---
***#
**##
*###
####
---
```
