# Challenge 25: Epilogue

Congratulations. You've made it to the end! I hope you've enjoyed the journey and had fun with it. Give yourself a pat on the back, relax, and reflect.

## Task

Write a program that prints the following things:

- A holiday greeting.
- What you enjoyed from the Advent.
- What part you felt could improve.
- And what part you would add.

## Example

```
example output:
Merry Christmas!
I enjoyed the little descriptions for each challenge, they added some flavor to them.
However, I feel like the difficulty curve could be refined - some challenges felt tough and out of place.
I would add some sort of co-op / duo challenge next time.
```
