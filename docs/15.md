# Challenge 15: Coal Transportation

After mining the coal yesterday, Santa wants to transport the coal to his base of operations. He has a Santa train, and he wants to know how many carriages he needs in order to transport all the coal.

## Task

You're given 4 variables:

- `CV` - The coal's volume (m³)
- `CW` - The coal's weight (kg)
- `MV` - The maximum volume of coal that each carriage can carry (m³)
- `MW` - The maximum weight of coal that each carriage can carry (kg)

You need to return how many carriages Santa's train will need to have. Sometimes you'll be limited by the maximum volume if the coal isn't very dense, and sometimes you'll be limited by the maximum weight if the coal is very dense.

## Example

```
CV: 10
CW: 1
MV: 10
MW: 10
Return: 1

CV: 10
CW: 20
MV: 10
MW: 5
Return: 4
```
