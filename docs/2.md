# Challenge 2: Hot off the press

The christmas shop is grateful for your previous work, and would like for you to repair more of their broken machines. This time, they would like you to automate their product tallying. However, seeing as their other machines are still broken, the input format is less than ideal: You will be given a text file containing a bunch of characters...

## Task

Your task is to design a program/function that returns a _list_ of numbers, given the name/location of a text file as input.

The file itself will consist of 4 lines, that look something like this:
```yaml
BBBBBBBBBBBB
MMMMMMM
CCCCCCCCCC
T
```
Where each line represents the amount of items in an order. In this instance, the order contains 12 balls, it was placed in July, contains 10 cookies and a tree.

Your output will be a list of numbers, where each number in the list represents the amount of a particular item. 

You can download the example file [here](2-input.txt)

## Example

```yaml
Filename: "2-input.txt"
File contents:
---
BBBBBBBBBBBB
MMMMMMM
CCCCCCCCCC
T
---
Return: [12, 7, 10, 1]

File contents:
---
B
M
C

---
Return: [1, 1, 1, 0]
```

Note: If you are doing this challenge with a language that does not work well with files, it is okay to ask the user to input the lines themselves.
