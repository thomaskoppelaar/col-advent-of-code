# Challenge 14: Cave Digging

Santa is running out of coal to give to all ~~populist politicians~~ the naughty people on his list: He's given you the task of scanning the coal mines for precious resources and choosing a location to drill for maximum efficacy. The scanning apparatus however, is a bit old and deprecated, so the input that you're working with is not ideal.

## Task

You're given a 1-dimensional array, `A`, that contains the amount of coal in each spot underground. You're also given `N`, which represents the actual depth of the scanned terrain.

You need to return a number that represents the (index of the) column of earth that contains the most amount of coal.

## Example

```
N = 3
A = [1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 5, 1, 2]
return: 0
visual representation:

*
1 0 1
2 0 0
5 1 2

where * indicates the column with the most amount of coal.

N = 2
A = [1, 0, 5, 4, 7, 0]
return: 1
visual representation:

  *
1 0 5
4 7 0


```

You can assume that the scanned terrain will always be rectangular (i.e the data fits in a (length(A)/N)xN) matrix).
