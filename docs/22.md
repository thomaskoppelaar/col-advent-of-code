# Challenge 22: A sour treat

The food department has a number of treats to test, and decides to gather some elves around a table to pass along the candy. The chef decides that the fairest way to divide the candy is to seat the elves around a circular table in sequentially numbered chairs. A chair number will be drawn from a hat. Beginning with the elf in that chair, one candy will be handed to each elf sequentially around the table until all have been distributed.

However, the chef puts less and less effort in each piece of candy: The last piece looks like all the others, but tastes awful. 

## Task

Determine the chair number of the elf that will receive the awful tasting candy.

Your input will be: 
- `N`: The number of elves
- `M`: The number of sweets
- `S`: The chair number to start passing out treats at.

To return: The chair number.

## Example
```py
N = 5
M = 2
S = 1
return: 2


N = 5
M = 2
S = 2
return: 3

N = 7
M = 19
S = 2
return: 6

N = 3
M = 7
S = 3
return: 3

```
