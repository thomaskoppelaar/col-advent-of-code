# Challenge 4: A perfect fit

Being happy with your work from yesterday, Santa asks you to do even more research: This time, he wants to have an idea of how much magic he needs to use in order to teleport his presents down each persons chimney. When asking how to calculate the amount of magic required, Santa says:

"Well, if the present fits through the chimney, it does not require any. If it does not, the present needs to be teleported. In that case, the amount of magic required is equal to the volume of the present.

## Task

You are to design a function, that takes the following arguments:

- `W` - the width of the chimney.
- `H` - the height of the chimney.
- `X` - the length of the present.
- `Y` - the height of the present.
- `Z` - the depth of the present.

The function should return the amount of magic required to get the present through the chimney.

Important thing to remember: A present can be rotated in order to fit through!

## Example

```yaml
W=2, H=2, X=1, Y=1, Z=3
Return: 0

W=4, H=1, X=5, Y=3, Z=2

Return: 30

W=10, H=3, X=7, Y=8, Z=3

Return: 0

```
Note: You only need to worry about rotating the present by 90 degrees in any axis.
