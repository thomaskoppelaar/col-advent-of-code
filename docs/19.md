# Challenge 19: Another Hidden message

Santa has received yet another encoded message. It looks like a grid of random letters, hmmm...


## Task

As an input you'll be given a grid `G` which will be an array of strings, you'll also be given a string `S`, which will be a string hidden in the grid. You need to output the starting location of the string in the grid, you'll also output whether the string is vertical or horizontal.

## Example
```yaml
G: ["YHG", "ICE", "TCE"]
S: "ICE"
Return: "Col 1, Row 2, Horizontal"
Representation:
       1 2 3
    1  Y H G
    2  I C E
    3  T C E

G: ["EBWS", "PFDN", "HBMO", "URFW", "MGLK"]
S: "SNOW"
Output: "Col 4, Row 1, Vertical"
Representation:
       1 2 3 4
    1  E B W S
    2  P F D N
    3  H B M O
    4  U R F W
    5  M G L K
```

Note: The string will always be either left to right or up to down; no reverse order and no diagonals.
