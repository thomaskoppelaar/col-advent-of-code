# Challenge 24: Δv/Δt

Santa wants to know how long he'll take to clear an area on his map. When Santa is travelling he doesn't reach his maximum speed instantaneously, so you'll have to take acceleration into account.

## Task

You are given a map `M` which is a string of 1's and 0's, where the 1's represent houses and 0's represent empty areas. When Santa reaches a house, he stops and then starts accelerating again from a speed of 0. Each 0 or 1 is a metre in length. Santa needs to know how much time he'll need to clear the map given the variables `A` and `S`, which are his acceleration in m/s² and maximum speed in m/s respectively. You'll output the time needed to reach the last 0 or 1, in seconds.

## Example
```yaml
M: "001"
A: 1
S: 10
Return: 1.5

M: "001"
A: 1
S: 1
Return: 2

M: "00101"
A: 2
S: 5
Return: 1.25
```
Note: We aren't counting the time which Santa will spend in the house itself, so essentially Santa clears houses instantly.
