# Cave of Linguists - Tech Club Advent of Code

It is alive and kicking baby

`If you're confused as to what the Cave of Linguists is: go to` https://discord.gg/cave-of-linguists

## Premise

Each day of december, a new challenge will be posted here. For each challenge you complete, you earn points based on the milestone you have reached.

The milestones are as follows:
```
25 complete: 500 points

20 complete: 300 points

10 complete: 150 points

5 complete: 50 points

1 complete: 25 points
```
## Leaderboards (WIP)


The leaderboards showcase all the beautiful people that have completed challenges. This is purely for vanity reasons, and totally not for creating competition. 

You get no extra points for reaching a high place, only bragging rights :P

## Submissions

You'll submit your code by going to [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SsjQ2lDbAs_g1H49ZS44y6Tw1KuX3sM9f6GKW_YaNaI). 

Rules for submission:
- You can submit challenges at any given time, even earlier ones.
- You should link to a place where we can view your submission clearly.
- If possible, link to a place such as repl.it so that we can easily test your solution.
- If not, add comments stating how the submission should be run.



## Challenges:
Every challenge will be added at roughly 12:00AM UTC+0 - ping `waterboi.#8134` in tech-club if he forgets to do so.
